Hi! My name is Ena and I'm a senior at UCLA studying Statistics & Data Science. My current interests lie in exploring how artificial intelligence can be leveraged in data transparency, fashion, and music tech. I recently started working at Superfan, a music social media app that uses AI and classification techniques to create meaningful connections among Spotify users.

Some of my other passions include entrepreneurship and fashion. At 16 I started my own clothing company, <a href="https://enastz.wixsite.com/mysite">Reverie</a>, a line of 12 ready to wear pieces. With the emergence of AI, NFTs, and the metaverse, I am also interested in how fashion design can be a personalized experience for the wearer.

And when I'm not in class or working, I'm likely running! I ran the Amsterdam Marathon in 2023 and plan on completing the Los Angeles Marathon in 2024.
